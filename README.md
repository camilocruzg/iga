A software implements the genetic algorithm (NSGA-II with modification) to help architectural student or designers to generate and evolve architectural forms. The software has an interactive GUI that enables users to customize the criteria of evaluation. User can iteratively run the software until they get ideal forms.

## Overview
This software is built on Grasshopper, which is a graphical editor integrated with a 3D modeling software named Rhino. Moreover, it requires an external running server to execute genetic algorithm.
This project is a 25 points Capstone Project for student from MIT, University of Melbourne, collaborated with a researcher from Melbourne School of Design and under guidance from Associate Professor Michael Kirley at Melbourne School of Engineering.
